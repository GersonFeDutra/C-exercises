How would you test the (word count program)[../samples/10-s.5.4_text_counting]? What kinds of input
are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

I would test it by trying different types of input. I don't think that are inputs that may uncover
bugs in this case, because all the inputs that aren't specified are being treated by the `else`
statement.
